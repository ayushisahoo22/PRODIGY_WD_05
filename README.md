### 🌦️Weather App:

A lightweight and responsive web application that shows real-time weather information for any city around the world.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project fetches live data from the OpenWeather API and displays the temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the searched location.

### ✨Features:

🔍 Search by City: Enter the name of any city to get current weather data.

🌡️ Temperature Display: Shows the current temperature in Celsius.

💧 Humidity: Displays the current humidity level.

🍃 Wind Speed: Provides real-time wind speed data.

⚡ Dynamic Data: Uses JavaScript and API calls to fetch and update data instantly without refreshing the page.

📱 Responsive Design: Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

### 🛠️Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the web page.

CSS: Styling for layout, responsiveness, and visual design.

JavaScript: Logic to handle API requests, process responses, and update the DOM dynamically.

OpenWeather API: Source of real-time weather data.

### 📌How It Works:

The user enters a city name into the search box.

When submitted, a JavaScript function sends a request to the OpenWeather API using fetch().

The API responds with weather data for that city.

JavaScript extracts relevant details: temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

The app then updates the webpage to show this data in a clean and readable format.

### This project is a great way to learn:

Working with REST APIs in JavaScript.

Handling asynchronous data with fetch and promises.

Updating the DOM based on API responses.

Building a simple, responsive layout with HTML and CSS.
